The file which contains the algorithm is process.cpp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The algorithm itself is option 5 in process_function()

It does two things:

Alorithm 1 : Used to detect out-of-bed event

Detects activity and considers this to be the foreground.
To detect activity it breaks teh image is 5X5 blocks.
Each block with enough chnaged pixels is considered an active block.
The bounding rectangle of all active blocks is the active region.
The top line of the active region is assumed to be the perosns height.
The centre of activity is also detected.

Algorithm 2 : Used to detect if the medication cup was moved

#Running the node
In order to run the code you need to run the following command:
roslaunch motion_analysis motion_analysis.launch

#Parameters
Edit the parameters.yaml file in the config folder of the package.

#Testing
If you want to test the code, you can use the .bag file provided in the test folder of the package.
This file includes an image topic that the node should subscribe to. Play the .bag file by running:
rosbag play /path/to/package/src/test/test_motion_analysis.bag
